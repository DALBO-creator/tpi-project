# 🎟️ Events — TPI Computer Science Project

A **complete educational project** for the **TPI course** (*Tecnologie e Progettazione di Sistemi Informatici e di Telecomunicazioni*), showcasing the full development lifecycle of a **web and mobile event management platform**.  
Designed using **Figma** and documented as a **professional IT project**.

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository was developed as an **educational exercise** to simulate the creation of a **real-world software project**, focusing on:
- Project planning and documentation  
- UI/UX design using **Figma**  
- Structuring deliverables and assets as if for a real client  
- Applying professional development standards  

The project follows the same organization and documentation style used in real development workflows.
