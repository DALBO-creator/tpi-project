# 🎟️ project-computerScience-tpi

A **professional example repository** created for the **TPI** course (*Tecnologie e Progettazione di Sistemi Informatici e di Telecomunicazioni*).  
This project demonstrates **how to plan, document, and present** a complete computer science project — in this case, a **web and mobile app for managing events** — using **Figma** and structured documentation.

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository was developed as an **educational exercise** to simulate the creation of a **real-world software project**, focusing on:
- Project planning and documentation  
- UI/UX design using **Figma**  
- Structuring deliverables and assets as if for a real client  
- Applying professional development standards  

Although no functional code is included, the project follows the same organization and documentation style used in real development workflows.

## 🎯 Project Concept

**Project name:** *Events*
**Type:** Web application  
**Purpose:** To allow users to discover, organize, and manage local or global events through an intuitive digital platform.  

Key features (conceptual):
- Event creation and browsing  
- Ticket reservation simulation  
- User authentication and profile management (concept design)  
- Responsive UI design for web and mobile  

---

## 🧩 Key Learning Points

- Structuring a **professional IT project** repository  
- Documenting requirements, design choices, and workflows  
- Designing realistic UI/UX prototypes in **Figma**  
- Using GitHub as a professional presentation platform  
- Simulating a client-ready project package
